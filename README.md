# dh140finalproject

## Data Description
The data analyzed in this project is compiled by the Graphic Narrative Corpus (GNC). The dataset includes metadata such as the book title, author, illustrator, genre, publication date, and language. I might investigate the genres present in graphic novels or investigate trends in graphic novels during a time period.

## Motivation
I am interested in exploring how graphic novels have evolved over time. I do not know very much about the history of graphic novels, thus I want to take a broad approach to exploring this dataset.


## Question(s)
* What conclusions can be made about the gender ratio of authors of graphic novels?
* Why does one country have more graphic novel authors than others?
* What can be observed with the top 10 most popular books?
* Describe any pattern(s) observed in when graphic novels were published?
