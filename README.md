## Data Description
The data analyzed in this project is compiled by the Graphic Narrative Corpus (GNC). The dataset includes metadata such as the book title, author, illustrator, genre, publication date, and language. I might investigate the genres present in graphic novels or investigate trends in graphic novels during a time period.

## Motivation
I am interested in exploring how graphic novels have evolved over time. I do not know very much about the history of graphic novels, thus I want to take a broad approach to exploring this dataset.


## Question(s)
**Subject to change**
* What patterns/trends can be observed in the original language of graphic novel publications over time?
* Why is a particular genre more popular than others?
* If a popular genre is replaced by another genre over time, why?
* Why is one type of adaptation more popular than other forms of adaptation for graphic novels?
* Why are some graphic novels adapted more often than others?
